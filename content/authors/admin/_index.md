I am an economics PhD student at Northwestern University working as a Data Science Intern at [Early Warning Services](https://earlywarning.com/), creators of [Zelle](https://www.zellepay.com/). Through my coursework and research projects, I've developed significant skill at applied econometrics and causal inference. 

I have several years of experience programming in Python and R according to modern technical standards. I use Git for version control, maintain my own PostgreSQL databases on AWS RDS, use Terraform to provision AWS EC2 instances for scripts which cannot be run locally, and use a combination of pipenv and Vagrant to create reproducible programming environments.

I was featured on [FLOSS Weekly](https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly/episodes/481) to discuss [Chomper](./project/chomper), my open-source Python internet blocker for Linux. Almost all the code on this project was written by me, and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/aniketpanjwani/chomper).

My dissertation focuses on the economics of the media. In [one dissertation chapter](./project/patreon), I study the impact of the introduction of subscription revenue streams on the behavior of online content creators. In [another dissertation chapter](./project/newspaper-strikes), I study how labor unions respond to technological change in the American newspaper industry.
