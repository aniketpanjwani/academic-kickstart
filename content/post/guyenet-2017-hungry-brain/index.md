One of the main advocates for low-carbohydrate diets is Gary Taubes, a prominent science journalist and author. I had read one of his books, *insert book name*, which *what it does*. In recent years, Taubes has been a proponent for the "insulin theory" of fat acquisition. *Describe the insulin theory*.

About five months ago, as I was looking for a podcast to listen to, I came across a debate/discussion between Gary Taubes and Stephan Guyenet on the Joe Rogan Experience, a popular long-form interview style podcast. *Describe what they were debating* Taubes' name piqued my curiosity, but Stephan Guyenet's scientific rigor really won me over.

## Tasks
+ Write a zettel about the insulin theory.
+ Maybe remove personal history, and move to a separate post.

[^3]: The literature usually cites either 20g or 50g.
